Welcome to the Car Sharing Console Application project! This project simulates the core functionalities of a car-sharing system using Java. It showcases how a console-based program can be built using object-oriented principles without the need for frameworks like Spring.

The application is structured to manage companies, cars, and customers through a flow controlled entirely in the Main class. It incorporates DAO (Data Access Object), service, and model classes for modular and organized code.

Key Features
This project provides essential features to manage car-sharing operations:

Company Management:

Add, view, and manage car-sharing companies.
Car Management:

Add cars under specific companies and retrieve car details.
Customer Management:

Add customers and allow them to rent or return cars.
Menu-Driven Flow:

Interactive menus that guide users through various car-sharing functionalities.
Core Concepts Demonstrated
This project highlights important programming and architectural concepts:

DAO Design Pattern: Separate data access logic using DAO classes for entities like Car, Company, and Customer.
Service Classes: Encapsulate business logic in services for each entity, improving modularity.
Object-Oriented Programming: Implement encapsulation, abstraction, and classes to represent real-world entities.
Console Application Design: Build an interactive program with a clear flow controlled in the Main class.
Learning Objectives
Through this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in:

Modular Design: Understand how to structure a project into DAOs, services, and models.
Data Handling: Simulate data persistence and retrieval using simple in-memory data management.
OOP Practices: Learn to design and use objects effectively in Java.
Console Interaction: Build user-friendly CLI menus for program navigation.
Project Structure
The project includes the following components:

Model Classes: Represent core entities such as Car, Company, and Customer.
DAO Classes: Handle data persistence and CRUD operations.
Service Classes: Manage business logic and interactions between DAOs and the Main class.
Main Class: Controls the overall program flow and user interaction.
This project is ideal for beginners who want to deepen their understanding of Java, OOP, and console-based application design while exploring the basics of designing modular and maintainable code.
